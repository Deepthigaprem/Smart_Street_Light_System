Troubleshooting:

~ Problem Faced:
The PIR sensor was not providing accurate readings and was overly sensitive, causing the LED to turn ON even when no motion was present.
~ Solution:
The sensitivity and delay were adjusted.
However, inconsistent readings still occurred.
To overcome this issue, the PIR sensor was replaced with an IR sensor, which provided more stable and reliable motion detection.

Future Improvements:

~ Replace Arduion with ESP32.
~ Add IoT dashboard.
~ Mobile app control.
